# Modern Data Warehouse & Analytics Showcase

Welcome to the Modern Data Warehouse & Analytics Showcase! 🚀
This project illustrates an end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution—from raw data ingestion to generating business insights. It’s designed as a portfolio piece to demonstrate real-world data engineering and analytics best practices.

# 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project implements a layered data architecture inspired by the Medallion approach:

Bronze Layer – Raw data from source systems is ingested as-is (CSV, JSON, or API feeds) into a staging database.

Silver Layer – Data is cleaned, standardized, and enriched to prepare for analytics.

Gold Layer – Business-ready datasets are modeled in a star schema, optimized for reporting and decision-making.

# 📖 Project Overview

The project covers the following key areas:

### Data Engineering:
Building a modern data warehouse using SQL Server and Python.

### ETL Pipelines:
Extract, transform, and load data from multiple sources into the warehouse.

### Data Modeling:
Designing fact and dimension tables for efficient analytical queries.

### Analytics & Reporting: 
Generating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable business insights.

This project is ideal for showcasing skills in:

SQL Development

Data Engineering

ETL & Pipeline Development

Data Modeling & Warehousing

Analytics & Reporting

# 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is structured to support an end-to-end data warehousing and analytics workflow. At the top level, datasets/ contains the raw source data used in the project, while docs/ holds all documentation, including architecture diagrams, data flow visuals, data models, and a catalog describing each dataset. The scripts/ folder is organized into Bronze, Silver, and Gold subfolders, reflecting the Medallion Architecture layers, with SQL scripts for loading raw data, transforming and cleaning it, and building analytical models. tests/ includes scripts to validate data quality and integrity, ensuring reliability. Core project information is in README.md, dependencies are listed in requirements.txt, and LICENSE and .gitignore manage usage rights and ignored files. This structure ensures clear separation of raw data, transformation logic, documentation, and testing, making it easy to follow and maintain.
