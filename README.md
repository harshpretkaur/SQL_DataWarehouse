This project is designed to demonstrate a scalable system architecture that integrates multiple components to deliver a reliable and efficient solution. It focuses on streamlining data flow between services, ensuring modularity, and enabling easy future enhancements.

Key features include:

Modular Design – Each component is clearly defined, making the system easy to maintain and extend.

Data Flow Management – Smooth communication between components ensures accuracy and consistency.

Scalability – The architecture supports growth and can adapt to increased demand.

Documentation – The included architecture diagram provides a high-level overview of the system structure and interactions.

This repository serves as a reference implementation for understanding system design best practices and can be adapted for real-world applications.
